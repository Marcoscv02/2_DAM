Hello everyone!
Today, we have another mini lesson about suffixes that talk about people. As you may know, 'suffixes' are little groups of letters that we put on the end of other words.

Professionals
We can use the suffix '-er' to talk about a person who does something.

teach - teacher
learn - learner
work - worker
bank - banker
dance - dancer
We can also use '-ist' with the same meaning.

cycle - cyclist
psychology - psychologist
piano - pianist
guitar - guitarist
art - artist
Unfortunately, there's no easy way to know which ending to use with each word. We just need to learn the forms.

I kope that helps, and really good luck with your English!
