Hello everyone!
Let's talk about when we use 'the' with transport.

First, we often use the when we are talking about a form of transport as a general idea.We usually do this with public transport (not with cars or bikes) and we usually useverbs such as take, be on, get on and get off:

We took the bus to school.
Julie's on the train at the moment.
She gets off the underground in central London.
In all of these examples, I'm not talking about a particular bus, train or plane but rather the system of transport as an idea.

However, we use 'no article' when we use a form of transport with by:

We travelled by plane.
He goes to work by bus.
We went to Scotland by train.
Remember, we can't say 'by foot' or 'by feet' when we're talking about walking. We say 'on foot' (also no article)

I hope that helps, and really good luck with your English!
